# Multithreaded Proxy Server

Multithreaded Proxy Server built from scratch using sockets
It can connect to remote servers on behalf of clients
Handles each request in a separate thread
Can be configured to limit the maximum number of threads, 
then as soon as one request completes, one of the waiting requests will be picked up
